This is the deployed link to the website https://bhaveshgitstar.github.io/jiitpathfinder-collegmap/. I created using JavaScript, Bootstrap, and basic HTML, CSS for the frontend. In this I also used home php but it is optional.

Instructions:
1.You can download it and run index.html or else use the deployed link.
2.Choose the algorithm (Dijsktra) and choose starting point.
3.Choose the ending point and you can see the path to navigate.
